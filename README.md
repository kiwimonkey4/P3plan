As a part of the 1P13 course at McMaster University, we have had the opportunity to create an app catered towards our client diagnosed with Usher syndrome.
She expressed her struggle to distnguish between different items when grocery shopping, which is the primary problem that led to the development of EchoCart.

EchoCart is an intuitive, easy-to-use app which helps our client identify grocery items by feeding images captured by the user to a GPT model. The model returns a product and brand name which is then read aloud to the client. 
Our app also has features that allow the client to change the speed at which the voice reads the product info in addition to an interactive shopping list.
